# A Better main Function

This is my interpretation of a better main function build on
the Jason Turner's C++ Weekly episode 361. This implementation
includes:
- parsing command line arguments to a vector;
- convenience conversion functions for numeric arguments;
- the ability to generate a rudimentary Bash command line completion file;
